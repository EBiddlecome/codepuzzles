# Code Puzzles

Varied approaches to classic problems || Iterative self improvement via the algorithmic approach

## JavaScript

1. [Reverse A String](./reverseAString.js): Display the characters of a string in reverse order
2. [Reverse A Sentence](./reverseASentence.js): Display the words in a sentence in reverse order
3. [Merge Arrays](./mergeArrays.js): Given two arrays, return them combined as a single array, sorted in ascending order
4. [Is Unique String](./isUniqueString.js): Determine whether all characters in string are unique
5. [Is Unique String RegEx](./isUniqueStringRegEx.js): Use regular expressions to determine whether all characters in string are unique
6. [Is Permutation](./isPermutation.js): Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
7. [Fibonacci Index Iterative](./fibonacciIndexIterative.js): Return the value that would be present at n index in the Fibonnacci sequence
8. [Fibonacci Index Recursive](./fibonacciIndexRecursive.js): Return the value that would be present at n index in the Fibonnacci sequence
